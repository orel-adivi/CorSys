# Support for CorSys

Welcome to CorSys!

CorSys is a demonstrative program synthesizer, which synthesizes best-effort Python expressions
while weighting the chance for mistakes in given user outputs, using various metrics for mistake
probability evaluation. 

## How to Run?

Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/orel-adivi/CorSys/blob/main/README.md)
and the [website](https://orel-adivi.github.io/CorSys/) for further information.
